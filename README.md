## For Online Usage
Must be a member thats is logged in to use most website features.
## For Local Usage
Before you start, be sure to be in command line and "cd" to app's file location.
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this app's directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
